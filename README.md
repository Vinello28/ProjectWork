# ProjectWork

his application is designed to help manage a clinic, allowing users to register patients, manage their medical records, and utilize machine learning algorithms to predict diseases.

## Key Features

- **Patient Management**: Register new patients, view and edit their basic information.
- **Medical Record Management**: Add new medical records for each patient, view the history of existing medical records, and update details as needed.
- **Disease Prediction**: Utilize machine learning algorithms to predict potential diseases based on patient data and their medical records.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0)
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the C# extension.

## Installation Guide

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/ProjectWork.git

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code).

3. Build and run the application:
    Visual Studio 2022: Open the solution file (.sln) and press F5 to start debugging.
